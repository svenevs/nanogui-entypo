# Updating Entypo for NanoGUI

Clone this repository inside of `nanogui/resources`.  This should result in the
directory structure `nanogui/resources/nanogui-entypo`.

Go there, into the subdirectory `nanogui_gen`.  Execute `./generate.py` and then
execute `./do_copy.py`.  Go back up to `nanogui/resources` and run `git status`
to see what has changed.
